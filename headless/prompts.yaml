  EVALUATION TASK:
  Analyze the following conversation between a customer (User) and an AI agent (Agent) based on the agent's predefined characteristics in a structured format.

  AGENT SPECIFICATIONS:
  - Persona Guidelines: {persona}
  - Required Language: {language}
  - Agent Role: {role}

  CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT:
  {transcript}

  IMPORTANT NOTES:
  - Speaker labels (User/Agent) may be incorrectly assigned due to automatic transcription
  - Use context clues and content to identify who is speaking
  - Focus on the agent's responses, not the user's messages
  - Consider the entire conversation flow, not isolated statements

  EVALUATION CRITERIA:

  1. PERSONA ADHERENCE (Score: 1-5)
  Assess how well the agent embodies its defined persona and role through language, wording, and communication style throughout the interaction.

  Scoring Guidelines:
  - 5 (Excellent): Agent's wording and communication style perfectly matches the defined persona. Language choices, phrasing, and tone consistently reflect the character, regardless of conversation outcome.
  - 4 (Good): Agent's language and style strongly align with the persona with only minor deviations in wording or phrasing that don't compromise character consistency.
  - 3 (Mid): Agent demonstrates basic persona understanding through language choices but with noticeable inconsistencies in wording or communication style.
  - 2 (Poor): Agent's wording and communication style only occasionally reflect the defined persona, frequently using language that doesn't match the character.
  - 1 (Failing): Agent's language and communication style show no alignment with the defined persona, completely missing the character's voice and manner of speaking.

  Consider:
  - Consistency of language choices and phrasing that match the persona
  - Appropriate vocabulary and communication style for the defined character
  - Maintaining persona voice even when unable to help or when repeating questions
  - Character-appropriate responses regardless of conversation success or failure
  
  IMPORTANT: Do not penalize for failed problem resolution, repeated questions, or inability to understand user input. Focus solely on whether the agent's wording and communication style match the defined persona.

  2. LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY (Boolean: true/false)
  Determine if the agent maintained communication in the specified language throughout the conversation.
  
  Evaluation:
  - false: Agent consistently used the specified language with no switches
  - true: Agent switched to a different language at any point during the conversation
  
  Note: Consider context - if user switches languages, brief clarification in user's language followed by return to specified language may not count as a switch.

  3. USER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS (Select: happy, neutral, angry, disappointed)
  Analyze the user's overall emotional state and satisfaction level based on their responses throughout the conversation.

  Sentiment Indicators:
  - Happy: Expressions of satisfaction, gratitude, positive feedback, enthusiastic responses, successful resolution
  - Neutral: Factual exchanges, no strong emotional indicators, matter-of-fact communication, routine interactions
  - Angry: Frustration, harsh language, complaints, aggressive tone, demands for escalation
  - Disappointed: Unmet expectations, mild frustration, dissatisfaction, resigned acceptance of poor service

  Consider:
  - Overall conversation trajectory and resolution
  - User's language patterns and word choices
  - Frequency and intensity of emotional indicators
  - Final conversation outcome and user's closing sentiment

  Provide your evaluation based solely on evidence from the transcript. Be objective and specific in your assessment.
