    Mock authentication function that always returns True
    
    This is a drop-in replacement for the external requestAuthenticator
    that bypasses authentication for production deployment.
    
    Args:
        request: FastAPI Request object (optional)
        
    Returns:
        bool: Always returns True (authenticated)
        
    Note:
        If you need actual authentication in production, you can modify this
        function to implement your preferred authentication logic:
        - API key validation
        - JWT token verification
        - Basic authentication
        - etc.
    """
    # For production use, you might want to implement actual authentication here
    # Example implementations:
    
    # 1. API Key authentication:
    # api_key = request.headers.get("X-API-Key")
    # return api_key == "your-secret-api-key"
    
    # 2. Simple token authentication:
    # auth_header = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    # if auth_header and auth_header.startswith("Bearer "):
    #     token = auth_header.split(" ")[1]
    #     return token == "your-secret-token"
    # return False
    
    # 3. No authentication (current implementation):
    return True


# Alternative: If you want to completely disable authentication,
# you could also modify the FastAPI endpoints to remove the Depends(requestAuthenticator)
# dependency entirely, but that would require changing the existing code.
